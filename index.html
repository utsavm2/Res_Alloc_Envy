            <p>
                Resource Allocation Envy is a web application that helps you to allocate resources to different people in a fair manner. It is based on the concept of Envy-Free Resource Allocation.

            <h2>How it works?</h2>
            <p>
                You need to enter the number of resources and the number of people. Then you need to enter the value of each resource for each person. The application will then calculate the allocation of resources to each person in such a way that no person envies the resources of another person.
